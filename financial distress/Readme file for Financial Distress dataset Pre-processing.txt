1. Finding the research paper along with my other group members for the results to be reproduced
2. Discussing with and helping my group members in deciding what all datasets to be used for execution and how to find new datasets. 
3. Finding and pre-processing my new individual dataset and pre-processing it in the following way/steps
- Removing company values from the dataset.
- Removing the predictor variables from x2 to x83 from the dataset and taking only x1 while processing. 
- Taking transpose of the time values of x1 for each company from 1-422 and converting the dataset into time series format.
- Re-encoding the financial distress values into labels 0 or 1 depending on the values in the original dataset.
- After this converting the data frames into CSV format and splitting the data into training and testing files and also appending the financial distress column having the labels '0' or '1' as the first column in the train and test CSV files.
- Converting the training and testing CSV files to TSV format.
